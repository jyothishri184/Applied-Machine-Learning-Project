# Epilepsy Detection using EEG 🧠

**Medical Research Project using machine learning algorithms**

## Introduction
📍Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by sudden and abnormal electrical activities in the brain. It can be detected and monitored using Electroencephalography (EEG), a medical test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain. During the EEG test, small sensors are attached to the scalp to pick up the electrical signals produced when brain cells send messages to each other.

## Problem Statement
🚀Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is a critical concern. Studies suggest that each year, there are about 1.16 cases of SUDEP for every 1,000 people with epilepsy. A seizure may lead to pauses in breathing (apnea) or result in a dangerous heart rhythm, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.

## Approach
- **Data Collection:** Gather EEG data from patients with epilepsy, including those who have experienced SUDEP.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from EEG signals to identify patterns associated with epilepsy.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Train machine learning models to classify EEG data and predict the likelihood of epilepsy and SUDEP.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement a system for continuous monitoring of EEG signals to provide timely alerts in case of abnormal activities.
